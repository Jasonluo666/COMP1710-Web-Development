    <h2>Reflections</h2>
	<ol>
		<h3><li>What I learnt</li></h3>
		<p>
			It's actually hard to conclude what I have learned through this course.. because I feel like all the things I made, from using JSBin to create an HTML page to complete my amazing personal website, comes from the study of this course. Generally, I got the idea of using CSS to decorate my page (e.g. navigation bar, background, table, forms). What's more, I learned to use online sources to improve my website, like W3School. To some degree, I also made tricky things by using Javascript. More importantly, I got the knowledge about how and why use validation.
			<br><br>
			Now it becomes easier for me to read the HTML code of some pages online, which helps me to understand how they work. I think this could be really beneficial as well in my further study (probably in cyber security).
		</p>
		<h3><li>Difficulities I met</li></h3>
		<p>
			I met several difficulties when I made my website. Frankly speaking, it's interesting that something seems easy to implement, like the video background, is actually hard to deal with, while something seems hard, like the navigation bar, is relatively easy to do. Personally, one problem that cost me a significant amount of time is the Photo Gallery. That's because there are several factors that I need to consider: what style should I use, whether it is fit to my website, how is the actual performance. 
			<br><br>
			One lesson I learned from difficulties is that, though programming skills are necessary, the design itself is the most important thing when creating a website. How to attract the visitors, make the pages comfortable to watch, some sort of interactions, all of these are very crucial.
		</p>
		<h3><li>Future Plan</li></h3>
		<p>
			My plan is to get further knowledge in web development. When I was constructing my website, I found there is a number of programming language for web development, like Javascript and PHP, and some awesome effects can be realized based on them. And also, since my website is about DOTA2, I found the official website of it was really impressing when I did the research. Hopefully, I could make web pages just like it.
