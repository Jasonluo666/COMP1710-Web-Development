    <h1>Me and My Passion</h1>

      <p>
        Hey there, my name is Jiangshan. I'm an exchange student at ANU and this is my second semester! Personally, I love traveling and meeting new people because it's very interesting to explore something new and amazing. I especially like play video games, which leads me to choose the theme about games. <br>

        More precisely, my web page is about an introduction(or advertisement) of game "Defense of the Ancients 2 (DotA2)". I have played this game for more than three years and somehow it helps me to learn the meaning of team spirit, and it could also make me relax after the schoolwork.<br>

        So, one purpose of my web page is to let more people know about this game and may be have fun with that. In the second place, probably that's what I can do for this game after I have got some much fun from that. And also, maybe I could learn more details about DotA2 while I'm looking for the information to build up my website.<br><br>

        The goals for my web page:
      <ol>
        <li>Briefly introduce DotA2 to the others who have not played that before</li>
        <li>Provide some pictures and videos to make the page more vivid</li>
        <li>Keep the web page in good structure and add some special effects</li>
      </ol>
      </p>
